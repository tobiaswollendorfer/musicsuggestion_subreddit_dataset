I just found out that the album Zaireeka existed and the concept behind it is mind-blowing. Four discs, meant to be started at the exact same time so they all sync together. But with factors like timing, volume and distance, there are supposed to be an infinite amount of different ways to experience the album. Of course, there is a YouTube video of the whole album synced perfectly.",

It was the fusion of metal/HC and math rock that has led to what I consider all the greatest metal music made. This trend picked up starting in 2005 with perhaps Love is Love/Return to Dust being the first great math post-HC album. \n\nI have a playlist of such music:\n\n> [Liquid Metal](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ROc3RCXW6PrPyQRJwZjBd?si=96b34eb7ab284bb9) - 18 hrs\n\nwhich contains metal/metalcore and HC all that have rhythms as precise as a Fibonacci sequence. With the exception of one album (Rusty by Rodan, the first great math hard rock album), all are from 2005 or later because that's how long it took for bands to start incorporating the math rock from the 90s into their music as the metal bands from the 80s and 90s didnt have the awareness or maybe ability to adapt. And certainly most metal bands are not that mathy.",

Pornetoally thunder rolls is my favourite though.\n\n\nDance/edm: edm has always been in the background for me so I don't really know. What my first edm influence was. I would give Basshunter a huge shout out for being pretty influential to me. Eifell 65 was probably the catalyst to edm though. And scooter got me more into hardcore genres\n\n\nPOP:\" the call\" backstreet boys goddamn this song still holds up Catchy pop tunes owe a lot from me to this song alone\n\n\nClassical: OK toss up. I did start appreciating classical until college when I took a music history class and I was captivated by Antonio Vivaldi particularly winter from from four seasons. That said. As a Disney life fan. Night on bald mountain by modest mussorgsky no doupt was huge \n\n\nLatin: lluvia al corezon by mana. It doesn't feel \"Spanish\" so mana was pretty easy to get into for me. Also salena from my childhood \n\nJazz: I have a hard stance that jazz is a live genre that nhoruda be experienced live and not recorded so I don't have much jazz recommendations. \n\n\nFunk and disco: September by earth wind fire. Don't need to say more if you haven't heard it do yourself a favor \n\n\nArab: jai ho by AR rhaman famously from slumdog millionaire. \n\nAfrican/ Highland: zombie by fela kuti dudes such a massive influence on Africa it's hard not to love him. \n\nPower metal \\m/ :  honestly dragonforce....but sacred worlds by blind guardian is a badass and bg is a widely regarded as one of the best definitely check out that song.",

Way Away is a good one!\n\nDon\u2019t forget about State Champs. All You Are Is History is a solid tune.\n\nLastly, some Against The Current would be swell. Infinity might be a good slightly edgy motivational tune to add to that playlist.",

The themes of it and lyricism are all about commoditization, isolation, and how technology is getting increasingly pervasive. The concept is that all of this is sung from the dingy, cigarette-smoke-filled lounge of a casino on the moon! You can smell Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and plenty of other books with similar ideas all over this thing. Explicitly, though, he references *1984* in the starting track, a book called *Pattern Language* on the 7th song, and there\u2019s an entire song called *Science Fiction*. \n\nThis is basically an excuse to recommend this album. It\u2019s so good! Plus, considering The Strokes and The Police examples, it\u2019s one I think you\u2019d like :)",

It's their *only* less than remarkable song, and I'm counting all the B-Sides and demos because they all have something special to offer. I'm not talking about the potentially problematic themes of the lyrics (I'll just say there's not very many of them), but the song itself is hopelessly derivative of the band's own sound. It's bizarre to me because Kurt was such a talented songwriter, the bare basic elements that make up the song seem beneath his abilities. No surprise the song had been kicking around for a few years before it landed on *In Utero* but it should have been a B-Side at best.\n\nOn the other end, P.O.D. is not my cuppa, but \"Alive\" is a great song no matter who wrote or performs it.",

        "comment_body": "Indigo De Souza has an album called *I Love My Mom*, and it definitely includes a lot of those things you\u2019re feeling right now. The first song is about neglect, and the second is about feeling pressure to be doing more / being more similar to the people around you. Plus, it\u2019s really good! Sounds like it was recorded in a garage, but like\u2026 as an amazingly positive thing.\n\nThe excellent band *Flyte* also has a few songs I think you\u2019d really like. *Orphans of the Storm*, *Everyone\u2019s A Winner*, and *Speech Bubble*, specifically. They\u2019re not explicitly about family, but\u2026 eh, they\u2019re close enough, and all very beautifully written! \n\nOkay, those are my big ones. Now, lightning round!\n\n*Pressure To Party* by Julia Jacklin. Self-explanatory. Technically about a breakup, but still works, I think!\n\n*Foolish Father* by Weezer. Corny as hell but still a jam. And it has maybe the best rock outro of all time. Debatably.\n\n*Freebird II* by Parquet Courts. Song written about his mother. She was on drugs, emotionally unavailable, but she loved her son. This isn\u2019t really about forgiveness; it\u2019s more about acceptance, and release. It\u2019s absolutely gorgeous.\n\nHope any of these songs can help get you through some tough feelings. They certainly helped me, at times. If you like any in particular, let me know and maybe I can recommend more like it! Have a nice day :)",

One time I was trying to explain the band Wolf Alice to a friend (we're both in our 40s) and I was like, \"Yeah, they're like a modern band that takes a lot of cues from 1990s alternative rock,\" because to me, that is shorthand for edgy, dark, punk-influenced artists like Nirvana, PJ Harvey, The Pixies, etc. And he responds, \"Oh, I love alternative rock - like Counting Crows, Matchbox 20...\" Those are bands are fine, and they definitely got played on alternative radio in the 1990s, but I'd never put on a playlist with Nirvana. \n\n[PJ Harvey - To Bring You My Love](https://open.spotify.com/album/2yMg8ronKfVDHngnlLNnl8?si=QAX9e2FWSVGstWqt7_QVpA)    \n\n[Veruca Salt - Eight Arms to Hold You](https://open.spotify.com/album/5ZqOSlcQ0fA7MZOgvpOJT5?si=6Q2gf6xPQPGfaJmR8PiuaA)\n\n[Wolf Alice - My Love Is Cool](https://open.spotify.com/album/6bRsXeFIUgPfYLZNprki2h?si=Rlt1oNdhRFGKozGe8Xp3Ug)   \n\nAnd sure, because I'll admit that Counting Crows do count: \n\n[Counting Crows - August and Everything After](https://open.spotify.com/album/4nKfZbCALT9H9LfedtDwnZ?si=sNZyHklRSsSCsmh33Q9xLw)",

It's kinda unlike the rest of their sound, but that's because they collaborated with the Dust Brothers, and they put together a masterpiece of sampling.  It's still awesome, and often cited as one of the best albums of the era.\n\nIf you want something more typical of the Beastie Boys most common sound, Ill Communication is the best one to get into.  Their first album, License to Ill, is kinda silly and juvenile, and it's the one that made them famous, but they really had abandoned that style by their third album, Check Your Head, and Ill Communication, the fourth album, is peak Beasties.  If you want The Beastie Boys Sound, Ill Communication is it.  If you want the best overall album they did, Paul's Boutique is it.  Then just explore the rest, like Hello Nasty and To The 5 Boroughs and the rest of it.",

For reference I've spent most of the free time in my life over the past 20 years combing through over 72,000 albums so far haha. From this list I'd strongly recommend starting with The War On Drugs, then Big Thief, then \"Sod's Toastie\" by The Cool Greenhouse! =)\r  \n\r  \nThe Cool Greenhouse - \"The Cool Greenhouse\"\r  \n\r  \nThe Cool Greenhouse - \"Sod's Toastie\"\r  \n\r  \nDucks Ltd - \"Modern Fiction\"\r  \n\r  \nIDLES - \"Crawler\"\r  \n\r  \nThe War On Drugs - \"I Don't Live Here Anymore\"\r  \n\r  \nBig Thief - \"Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You\"\r  \n\r  \nGuardian Singles - \"Guardian Singles\"\r  \n\r  \nThe Strokes - \"The New Abnormal\"\r  \n\r  \nJetstream Pony - \"Jetstream Pony\"\r  \n\r  \nDry Cleaning - \"New Long Leg\"\r  \n\r  \nGospel - \"The Loser\"\r  \n\r  \nGeese - \"Projector\"\r  \n\r  \nIan Noe - \"River Fools & Mountain Saints\"\r  \n\r  \nBonus Stuff:\r  \n\r  \nHere are three rock playlists I made recently featuring some \"hidden gem\" type songs.

His vocal qualities make him more like another instrument than a lyricist, that album is purely about music for me.\n\nBut then you look at something like Dark Side of the Moon.  Another musical masterpiece, for sure, but the lyrics hit so hard.  I mean FUCK, listen to Time, and it's a complete punch in the gut every time I hear it.

As a music lover, I have to really zone in to the lyrics to understand the message of the song, when I have available time to do so that is. Trying to do work while paying attention to lyrics can be very distracting. I like to chill out and take it easy (like laying on the floor staring at the ceiling kinda vibe) to really feel moved by lyrics.",

Sure there's the fast, heavy screamy & growly stuff but there's plenty of melodic stuff out there & the symphonic metal subgenre take a lot of influence from older styles & classical music. They'll often have songs or entire albums that tie together & will mix different voices like an operatic female & growling male for a \"angel vs. demon\" contrast as part of the storytelling, sometimes with a literal symphonic orchestra.\n\nA great example is [Nightwish - The Greatest Show on Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJepbPuqNU4) \\- Symphonic metal band, their 1t singer was operatically trained while their current one can do pretty much anything, they have heavy songs & lighter songs & this is an epic 4-movement piece that's all about the origins of life on earth.",

The one thing I said I'd never listen to was metal (I, wrongly, thought it was all noise and screaming.)\n\nThen I went to uni and ended up living with a prog/metalhead who made it his mission to start introducing me to the genre after I said I didn't think it was my thing.\n\nThe song that first got me into the genre was the live version of [Ghost Love Score](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Paon2GSO2btqO6qmS6hSE?si=5adc40e4f6fd4266) by Nightwish.\n\nMy first prog song was [Amazing Flight](https://open.spotify.com/track/1CUX67uFPqOBHgIGh94zKp?si=4fe3d18241ba41ea) by Ayreon.\n\nThe first song I found myself thinking 'holy shit, young me would have \\*hated\\* this but I love it' about was [Dream Theater - Panic Attack](https://open.spotify.com/track/5axwj3ekvw85989jjO8Ov8?si=37c38d728ece4c6f).\n\nAnd even my dislike of harsh vocals was finally overcome by [Seven Spires - Fearless](https://open.spotify.com/track/6xeficC9q10mizz4u5ia2X?si=750214119dda41c4).\n\nAaaand now metal makes up like 50% of the music I listen to.

The second half of the song is especially emotive and cinematic.)\n\nEarthside - [All We Knew and Ever Loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVh_Y4o3C0Y&pp=ygUmRWFydGhzaWRlIC0gQWxsIFdlIEtuZXcgYW5kIEV2ZXIgTG92ZWQ%3D) (This one is very epic. Like it's straight out of a movie trailer, but better. No vocals.)\n\nUnderworld - [And I Will Kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka4MZzdScRI) (This one is very lengthy and has a slow burn to it. It was used in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Summer Olympics.)",

If not, then you're seriously missing out.\n\nAnathema - *Weather Systems* (2012). Steven Wilson was the producer for Anathema's newer albums. Unfortunately, this band has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2020. Based on the bands in your image, I'd say you'd probably only like their latest 4 albums that were released in the 2010s.\n\nLeprous - *Malina* (2017). You might not like their first few albums.\n\nKingcrow - *Eidos* (2015)\n\nThe Dear Hunter - *Act V: Hymns With the Devil in Confessional* (2016). This band isn't all that similar to Porcupine Tree, but I think you'll still appreciate them based on the other bands in your image.",

They aren't my favorite powerful songs, but I know you'll like them:\n\nLeprous - [Alleviate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eFq16CXSU&pp=ygUTTGVwcm91cyAtIEFsbGV2aWF0ZQ%3D%3D). This is by far their most accessible song, and it's from their softest album. The rest of their discography is a lot more complex.\n\nEinar Solberg - [A Beautiful Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAE2y2RfHtg&pp=ygUgRWluYXIgU29sYmVyZyAtIEEgQmVhdXRpZnVsIExpZmU%3D). Einar Solberg is the frontman for Leprous. This song's from his debut solo album that he released last year.\n\nAnathema - [Untouchable Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av6sVWXeCWQ&pp=ygUdQW5hdGhlbWEgLSBVbnRvdWNoYWJsZSBQYXJ0IDE%3D). One of the most beautiful and powerful musical crescendos you will ever hear.\n\nSteven Wilson - [Pariah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTaFArEObU&pp=ygUUc3RldmVuIHdpbHNvbiBwYXJpYWg%3D) (Feat. Ninet Tayeb)\n\nHaken - [Earthrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ8KqJJJJhk&pp=ygURSGFrZW4gLSBFYXJ0aHJpc2U%3D) (Haken is pronounced as \"Hay-ken\".)",

Going to have to listen to more. \n\nThe first song I thought of was [All Over You](https://youtu.be/6j4ekSo-f7o?si=AMdykFbq3higdVFw) by Leisure, live in studio. They have a smoother sound and the singer does not have the rough voice you prefer, but I think you'll like it. \n\nI hear, in the guys voice, similar style as Bruno Mars. He is more a R&B musician than jazz or rock.\n\n[Treasure](https://open.spotify.com/track/55h7vJchibLdUkxdlX3fK7?si=aRLEdQUXTCGDak0s7H5fFg&utm_source=copy-link)\n\n[Liquor Store Blues](https://open.spotify.com/track/4KykoaJQ5UxjCpp3lYkvTE?si=Au1zkmiJQv-jHFyUwDnB_g&utm_source=copy-link) with Damien Marley \n\nYou might enjoy Macy Gray.

This song's from an album about a friend of the vocalist who died from an overdose. His friend's life was spiraling out of control due to the passing of his mother.\n\nSteven Wilson - [Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh5mWzKlhQY&pp=ygUXU3RldmVuIFdpbHNvbiAtIFJvdXRpbmU%3D). This one's a about a woman who lost her husband & kids in a mass shooting and she's struggling to let them go by trying to maintain her motherly \"routine\" because that's been the main purpose in her life for so long. The last couple minutes of this song makes me shed a tear every time, no matter what mood I'm in.\n\nLeprous - [The Last Milestone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKr1b1KmgYw&pp=ygUcTGVwcm91cyAtIFRoZSBMYXN0IE1pbGVzdG9uZQ%3D%3D). This one's about the father of the band's vocalist, Einar Solberg. His father committed suicide when Einar was 19. It's the most depressing sounding song in my catalog. Btw, Leprous are a rock band and this is their only song that doesn't feature any guitar, bass & drums.\n\nYou really need to hear these songs. Every second of them deserves your utmost attention.",

They sound like if you mixed Black Sabbath with The Beatles, with more of a leaning towards Sabbath and the 60s/70s psychadelic doom rock. \n\nBring Me The Horizon - \u201cSteal Something.\u201d A lot of their music is heavy but they released a trippy, experimental EP in December 2019, this is the first song on that EP and it\u2019s a super chill jam. \n\nBear Hands is really great while high, pretty much their whole discography but my favorites are: \u201c2AM\u201d, \u201cGiants\u201d, \u201cParty Hats\u201d, and \u201cCrime Pays\u201d. \n\nAnd if you like heavier stuff, the album Witchtanic Hellucinations by Acid Witch. It\u2019s like psychadelic stoner death doom.",

Always been too eclectic in tastes to stay in one genre. Still like some of the bands from then, but I gravitate towards melodies, and my opinion is thrash sacrifices much of its potential for the sake of showing off how fast you can play. Sometimes it is the notes not played..\n\nThat said none of these recommendations will be thrash, but they will all be heavy and hard driving similar to Iron Maiden (one of my favorites.) Staying in the 70's to begin.. if you like the song that I link the albums that they are from would be as good a place to go deeper..\n\nUFO,  [Lights Out](https://open.spotify.com/track/08GPy1h8jsXZ8O6VBuh4Fx?si=bAnhjsyVQ62sHVlZPUyUgg&utm_source=copy-link)\n\nThin Lizzy, [Kings Vengeance](https://open.spotify.com/track/7Dtq4Wk8WzOjbkoYb46Dax?si=Q_ewW3g5R0Snby_pQ9Qvrw&utm_source=copy-link)\n\nJudas Priest, [Electric Eye](https://open.spotify.com/track/3w9zHVKI28aUPZTxq8oDC6?si=EtACX_k9Q6S2qzx40Chldw&utm_source=copy-link)\n\nDeep Purple [Burn](https://open.spotify.com/track/5s8IEEjgCTrujK3aUalvfF?si=l81wx-wHSOGsfP6nUhHxOA&utm_source=copy-link)\n\n\nComing into the 80's /90's \n\nVan Halen, [Atomic Punk](https://open.spotify.com/track/6XzfupaB5ikgUMnrFgJBvS?si=aoy2O3ToTTW1vfEqf4b2Ng&utm_source=copy-link)\n\n\nGuns and Roses [Night Train]( https://open.spotify.com/track/7CBFRsUz1pz1cS12soVhih?si=R9-3ugskSTuZ32KrCRB9MA&utm_source=copy-link)\n\nIt's a tie for my favorite heavy band that is still active between these two \n\nTool, [Aenema](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nLOl4fSiBZKGFla5pLUtf?si=Fq3YGsknQKGkP7OgG26eow&utm_source=copy-link)\n\n\nThe Mars Volta, [Deloused In The Comatorium]https://open.spotify.com/album/0CA2EVHhRPR5VPV78KZw89?si=92VcpWoLSnyGEJpQ0tpukg&utm_source=copy-link)",

        "comment_body": "Peach Pit's album [Being So Normal](https://open.spotify.com/album/6xduu32sm4aidoLhaxYkUA?si=SjEavQD_QY6l6nOZ_E9eGQ) has lots of retro/vintage sorta feel to it. [Tommy's Party](https://open.spotify.com/track/5OuJTtNve7FxUX82eEBupN?si=u3kaQzsfQVeCkoTz-CfpdQ) sounds like the sorta thing that plays at a 60 high school dance in a movie lmao, while a song like [Chagus Sideturn](https://open.spotify.com/track/59JOMc9A6w8CkIHgs4kfNl?si=BbuoEHUmQHqeGTUz9qoNXA) captures a more retro and poppy essence. \n\nThe Backseat Lovers have a few songs that fit the vibe. [Pool House](https://open.spotify.com/track/74f0dpqHhTeTJzs4pmZ1yq?si=P98qGrs6T762a5iKRL8inw) is the best example\n\nThe album [Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XuBvAY640EaQpjG6XvnWy?si=mHpsqaHyTGWja8JICLJEHQ) by Born Without Bones. Something about this album in general just feels old-timey, especially compared to their other albums and the bands would they play with. Not all songs lean into it, but both [I Was in Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sAAl2Q1nLcQnwIunxeuaB?si=9380iUMDStq9T9KKhlVrOg) and [Stone](https://open.spotify.com/track/7EdO50H2O5QuqAcEGCKeFY?si=fJMSMbkpRfKzeNm01e5jGQ) have this sort of classical theater/doo-woppy sorta vibe to them. The other songs do still feel similarly theatrical, [Rough Terrain](https://open.spotify.com/track/3UtBmHQbRMJ6CokujPMEeP?si=-d-j01XeQBCRjtMs1y4Alg) being one of the songs where I actually can't point to a particular aspect, but it feels like it was written/arranged by an old soul or something, particularly the vocal melodies.",

Lots of twinkly tappy guitar riffs with absolutely insane drums. I cannot stress how absolutely disgusting the drums are. \n\nAutomatic- Mildlife: This album to me sounds like a fusion between Pink Floyd and Tame Impala. Maybe a little heavier on the Tame Impala. Groovy, funky, weird, jammy. For me the Bass is the stand out on this album. This one might not blow you away at first it\u2019s more of a grower. \n\nFear Inoculum - TOOL: The most mature TOOL album. It\u2019s heavy, but not really heavy for TOOL. It\u2019s introspective and sparse with vocals. It\u2019s almost an instrumental album with some vocals peppered in. The lyrics are incredible, however. To me this is arguably the best album to be released in the last 10 years. The drummer, Danny Carey, is my pick for GOAT. He does impossible stuff on the kit.",

A quick run through the current posts on this sub confirmed that for me (for example, I agree with the comment on the current top post that the picture reminds me of 'The Way' by Fastball, but it's more due to the music than the lyrics). But anyway,\n\n>do yall actually enjoy the song for its lyrics predominantly, or for its music predominantly, or does it have to be a sweet mix of both? Also, would you be able to enjoy a song with good lyrics but bad melody?\n\nThe appreciation of the music and melody is more *immediate*. If I thought a song had a bad/boring melody and/or music, I would likely never get to the point of appreciating the lyrics because I wouldn't like the song. If the music/melody is good enough that I will listen to the song enough to pay attention to the lyrics, then the lyrics can enhance my appreciation for the song (sometimes to a tremendous degree).\n\nAlso, there's more to lyrics than the meaning behind them. The sounds of the words that were chosen can have an immediate effect in the way that the music does. So in this sense, lyrics can't be fully separated from music, as lyrics have an element of the immediacy of music to them.",

Lyrics are easier for people to get stuck in their heads and gives them an opportunity to easily sing along/participate. For most average listeners music with focus on lyrics is the most accessible, effective and poignant, hence vocal driven music it dominating pop/sales/charts etc\u2026 it\u2019s just par for the course. As a fellow person who enjoys instrumentals and tends to focus on music first, it is a bit of a realization sometimes that most people don\u2019t listen/focus/appreciate the way we do. But that\u2019s ok, music appreciation like many things in life is a spectrum ranging from musicians/audiophiles to people who don\u2019t like music in general and don\u2019t really enjoy it. It is what it is\u2026\n\nTLDR: not really a hot take, most people everywhere focus on lyrics and vocals first.",

Earth Angel-The Crew Cuts \nhttps://youtu.be/R-KtkQJTvhk?feature=shared\n\nBut the original is a bit slower so may be better for dancing? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/R-KtkQJTvhk?feature=shared\n\n#2. Earth Angel-The Penguins\nhttps://youtu.be/-j6OAEOcNCE?feature=shared\n\n\n#3. My special Angel - Paul Rich (1957)\nhttps://youtu.be/LfKe5aIEKbs?feature=shared\n\n#4.  Only You-The Platters  (1955)\nhttps://youtu.be/dtqo3CDr_zs?feature=shared\n\n#5. Young Love-Sonny James (1956)\nhttps://youtu.be/japjX4EYnac?feature=shared\n\nGood luck finding your song!",

This song is pretty sad if not depressing. Fred Durst scarily sings and its really not bad. It's the only song I liked from their early days.)  \n[Alone by Eyeshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCggyp0sF_c) (Punk Pop band fronted by Johnny Yong Bosch who was the replacement for the original Black Power Ranger and also a pretty big Voice Actor. This is more of a slow sad punk song. Large part is clean, but eventually goes distorted, but still maintains that slow sad feeling)  \n[Alone by I Prevail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7uXLY0_Tfc) (Sad song focusing on one reflecting on what one had once had with someone and is struggling to keep things in check. Slow rock kind of vibe? Almost ballad like.)  \n[I Really Want to Stay at Your House by Rosa Walton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E) (Popularized from the Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime. Rosa Walton had confirmed the song was written after a break up and upon realizing that, the lyrics can be interpreted as missing that person on and off again. Electronic)",
